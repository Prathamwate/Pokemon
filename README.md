2. **DOM Manipulation**: I manipulated the DOM to display the retrieved account on the webpage. I used JavaScript to create and append HTML elements dynamically.

3. **Event Listeners**: I added event listeners to specific elements to handle user interactions.

Here is a brief overview of how I accomplished the task:

1. I used the Pokemon api to fetch data.

2. I used the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the Pokemon API using the provided URL.

3. Once I received the response from the API, I parsed the JSON data to extract the github account details.

4. I dynamically created HTML elements to display the github acccount information on the webpage, ensuring they are properly formatted and styled.

5. Finally, I hosted the project on a web server to provide a hosted link for submission.
